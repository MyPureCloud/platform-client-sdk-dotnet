Platform API version: 9635


## Release Notes
The Platform API SDK for .NET was leveraging ini-parser 3rd party library to read and load configuration from an INI file.
Due to the lack of support for recent .NET frameworks, this dependency is removed starting with this version of the Platform API SDK for .NET. The SDK instead uses built-in methods to read and load configuration from an INI file.
